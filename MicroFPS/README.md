OldWork/MicroFPS
================

Incomplete gaming framework (First Person Shooter) intended to be pluggable with different components. Intent was to make a
"build your own game-engine" using whichever components you see fit (i.e. pick your rendering engine, audio engine, AI logic,
etc.).

This may still be something I come back to in the future, however, at the present time it does not seem practical for
any real game development seeing as developers will want to develop specifically within the engines they select.
