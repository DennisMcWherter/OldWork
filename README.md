OldWork
=======

NOTE: All of this work is done *before* accepting my job.

This repository contains old work that I have done over the years. Most of the work is C/C++ since most of my web development
work was unfortunately lost in a server crash (Yes, years later, I have finally learned to create full backups now).

I make no guarantees about correctness or quality of this code. This repo is more for proof that I have written code as well
as maybe a stash for some ideas for me to come back to given time in the future.

That said, please keep in mind that much of this was written prior to having a better knowledge of Computer Science and
good software engineering practices.

Thus, this work ranges for years 2008-2012. Previous years (2003-2007) are undocumented.
