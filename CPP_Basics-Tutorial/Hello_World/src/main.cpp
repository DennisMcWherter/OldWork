// Here is the second way to comment :) But it ends when hitting return
#include <iostream> // Using the IOStream include. Later we'll be using the cstdio as it's preferrable imo

using namespace std; // Declare the namespace. This way we can access the "std" library for C++ giving us certain functionality

int main() // Definition of main function - This is where all C++ programs begin
{
	cout<< "Hello World" << endl << endl << "This is a C++ Program!" << endl;
	return 0; // Because this is an "int" (for integer) return a number value to the function. 0 exits.
}
