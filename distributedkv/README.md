OldWork/distributedkv
=====================

A distributed key-value store system for distributed systems course. Primarily developed for academic purposes.
Efficiency is limited due to problem constraints. The system is fault tolerant up to 2 concurrent node failures
with active replication.

This project was written over the course of about a week and also written with a partner (Nemo).

There are some questionable design decisions in this implementation.
