OldWork/WEB
===========

Some web work that I was able to find. I originally started doing web work in 2003 (angelfire/lycos/geocities) for an
Xbox live clan for the game Unreal Championship. I later moved passed these sites at the release of Return to Castle Wolfenstein
for the original Xbox and then began doing "real" web development (no site-builders) for my clan there.

NOTE: Most of these are in archives, so in the "OTHER" directory, the archives can be downloaded for those interested.
