I. Preface
==============

The multithreaded/cross-platform server software was created by Dennis J. McWherter, Jr.
of Microsonic Development. If you choose to use any part of this software in your own work,
please be sure to include proper credit to Dennis J. McWherter, Jr.


===========================
II. What is this software?
===========================

This software is an example of multi-threading (thread-pooling) with a text server. It hopefully
will provide ideas and some sort of explanation of how something like this may work.

==================================
III. What this software is _NOT_
==================================

This software is not a server with any RFC protocol associated with it nor any protocol at
all for that matter. The server simply sends and receives text to connected clients. It is 
under _NO_CIRCUMSTANCES_ production software. I am not distributing this software in hopes
that it (in its current state) will be of any practical use as is.

any server software, you open your computer to possible security holes an vulnerabilities.
